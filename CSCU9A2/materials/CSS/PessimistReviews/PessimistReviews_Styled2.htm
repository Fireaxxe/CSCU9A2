<h2>Europe 2011: Great Places to Miss</h2>
<p class="byline">Antonio Cervantes</p>
<p class="review">
Europe is brimming with world class attractions: glorious art galleries,
charming bed-and-breakfast inns, old school restaurants and much more. But who
can afford it? This book carefully documents some of the best attractions across
Europe, and provides detailed plans that explain how to miss them and keep your
last few paltry cents in your pocket. Guaranteed to keep you out of debtor's
prison when you return home. (You did buy a return ticket in advance, right?)
